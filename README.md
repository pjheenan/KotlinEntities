# KotlinEntities
Small demo project showing Java v kotlin for defining model/api entities. By using simple `Kotlin data class` definitions and `trait` definitions it is possible to dramatically reduce the code required to get model definitions up and running.

This project is supporting code to this [blog post](http://philheenan.com/kotlin-model-entities/)
